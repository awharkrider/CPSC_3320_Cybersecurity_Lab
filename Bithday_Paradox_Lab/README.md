## Objective
The objective of this lab is to write code to numerically validate the analytical claims in Section 11.2.3 in regards to the birthday paradox.

## Procedure
Write a program to validate the birthday paradox.  
Compute analytically the probability of at least one collision.  S
ee section 11.2 in the textbook. Uniformly assign birthdays (assume 365 days in a year) to t people.  
Then determine if anyone has the same birthday (a collision).  
Re-run the experiment many times to estimate the probability of a collision for that value of t.  
How many times do you need to run the experiment until the value settles (has a low error). 
Try different values of t such as 1, 23, 40, and 365 and verify that the simulation matches the analytical formula.
